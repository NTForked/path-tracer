Reference

Some of the comments make reference to Pharr and Humphreys' text
[pbrt.org](*Physically Based Rendering*), 2nd edition (Morgan Kaufmann, 2010).
This excellent resource describes the `pbrt` renderer in a literate
programming style.

My renderer is also influenced by Kevin Beason's
[http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/](smallpt) path tracer.
