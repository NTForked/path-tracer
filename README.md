Reference
---------
Some of the comments make reference to Pharr and Humphreys' text
[*Physically Based Rendering*](pbrt.org), 2nd edition (Morgan Kaufmann, 2010).
This excellent resource describes the `pbrt` renderer in a literate
programming style.

My renderer is also influenced by Kevin Beason's
[smallpt](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/) path tracer.
